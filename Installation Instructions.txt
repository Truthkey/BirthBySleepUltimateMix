INSTALLATION:

- Copy "KINGDOM HEARTS Birth by Sleep FINAL MIX.exe" to your Kingdom Hearts installation folder.
  For example, the default is "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\KH_1.5_2.5". When asked if you should overwrite, say yes.
- Drag and drop the "BBSUM.bbspcpatch" file to "KHPCPatchManager.exe" to let the patching of files begin.
  (If prompted to drag a folder, drag the "en" folder from wherever you installed the game)
  Wait for the patching to end until it says "Done!". Then you can close it with Enter of closing the window.
 
OPTIONAL:
 
- If you want to use the recolored unversed mod that comes bundled with BBSUM, do the same as above but also apply the "ColoredUnversed.bbspatch".
  The main reason why you would not want to use it, is because recolored enemies won't drop synthesis items or D-Link level ups, making melding harder.
- If you use recolored unversed and don't like them. A mod to revert them back to normal is also bundled.
- If you don't like the camera bundled with the mod, you can revert the camera applying the "RestoreCamera.bbspatch".
